deprec - Deployment Recipes for Capistrano
------------------------------------------

== Introduction

The deprec [1] gem is a set of tasks for Capistrano [2]. These tasks provide
for the installation, configuration and control of system services on servers
running Ubuntu linux. Deprec was created in 2006 by Mike Bailey to setup an
environment for running Ruby on Rails web applications on Ubuntu servers. Since
then its uses have grown to installing Xen virtualization, mail, monitoring, high
availability IP failover and other services.

The tasks are run at the command line on your workstation and connect to 
remote servers via ssh to run commands and copy out files.

Deprec-2.x is a complete rewrite of the project that achieves the following:

- support for Capistrano 2
- generated config files are stored locally to enable editing and version control
- support for more services (heartbeat, nagios, nginx, ntp, postfix, etc) 
- multiple Rails deployment options (Passenger+Apache, Mongrel+Apache/Nginx)
- creation of a standard base set of task names
- tasks are cleanly separated into namespaced units (one file per service)
- interactive prompting for missing config values

Deprec and Capistrano are written in the Ruby programming language [3] however 
no knowledge of Ruby is required to use it. Users should be able to write 
new tasks and modify existing options without prior knowledge of Ruby.


== Installation

Deprec can be obtained from rubyforge[4] and installed using rubygems[5].

	sudo gem install deprec  # installs deprec and dependancies 
	cap depify .			 # creates ~/.caprc which you may edit
	cap -T					 # should list lots of deprec tasks

The .caprc file is loaded every time you use Capistrano. It in turn loads 
the deprec tasks so you always have them available. Editing the .caprc file 
in your home directory allows you to specify the location of your ssh key
and enable some other useful options (documented in the comments). You can
also put tasks here that you want access to, regardless of the current working
directory.


== Getting a Ruby on Rails app running on a fresh Ubuntu server

This is still what brings people to deprec. You can install a full Rails stack
and get multiple apps running on it in much less time than it would take to 
do it manually (e.g. an hour vs. a weekend).

Get your app running on a fresh Ubuntu (7.10, 8.04) server with these commands:

    cd your_rails_app
    depify . 
    # Edit config/deploy.rb
    cap deprec:rails:install_stack

	# WARNING! Don't run the following command if you are using a shared 
	# database server that has already been installed.
	cap deprec:db:install 

    cap deploy:setup 
    cap deploy 
    cap deploy:migrate

Recorded times for complete install on Ubuntu hardy server (7.10 amd64)

	* Passenger+REE+Apache        : 14m29s
	* Passenger+ruby-1.8.7+Apache : 17m51s
	* nginx+mongrel               : 16m25s
	
Note you can choose combinations of:
	
	* Ruby Enterprise Edition or ruby-1.8.7
	* Passenger or mongrel (passenger requires you choose to the apache option)
	* Apache or nginx

You can find documentation on the deprec site. http://www.deprec.org/


== Installing other things

I plan to document other things I use deprec for on http://www.deprec.org/. 
Feel free to poke around and see what's there. I use deprec to provision and 
manage servers so you might find some things in there I haven't documented. Lucky you.


== Disclaimer

The tasks run commands that may make changes to your workstation and remote server. 
You are advised to read the source and use at your own risk.

Deprec was inspired and uses the brilliantly executed Capistrano. Thanks Jamis!
This gem includes a modified copy of Neil Wilson's very useful vmbuilder_plugins gem.
