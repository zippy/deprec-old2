== git
 
== 1.99.34 (February  6, 2009)

* Bugfix: restricted some tasks to certain roles

== 1.99.33 (February  5, 2009)

# Added options for :web, :app, :db and :ruby software to install/use.
#
# Newly generated deploy.rb files specify Passenger, Apache and Ruby Enterprise 
# Edition. If not specified, deprec defaults to Mongrel, Nginx and Ruby-1.8.7.
# This is so that existing users of deprec2 previews will not be affected.

* Added :ruby_vm_type option to choose between :mri and :ree Ruby versions

* Added :app_server_type
  :passenger [set in new deploy.rb]
  :mongrel   [default if not set]

* Added :web_server_type 
  :apache [set in new depoy.rb] (for :mongrel or :passenger apps)
  :nginx  [default if not set]  (for :mongrel apps) 

* Added :db_server_type
  :mysql [default]
  :postgresql
  :sqlite

# Other additions

* cap deprec:rails:setup_database

  Creates database and user for Rails app using data from database.yml.
  Respects value of :db_server_type

* Postgresql recipes [Eric Harris-Braun]

* Starling Recipes [Rob Caporetto]

* cap deprec:utils:handy 

    Installs a bunch of handy utils I can't live without:

    lynx nmap netcat telnet dnsutils rsync curl wget mailx mutt vim-full tree

* Updated Apache vhost template for mongrel. Supports https and puts in dummy
  certificate. Useful settings are:

  set :apache_ssl_enabled, true
  set :apache_ssl_forward_all, true

  http://github.com/mbailey/deprec/commit/d103dda7ee3f7696007d230c76c7739dd57115ec

* Extend capistrano_extensions.rb to allow install from git sources. [jasherai]

* Updated git to 1.6.0.1 [thornysun]
 
== 1.99.27 (August 27, 2008)

* Bugfix: Add configure and make options to src_package for rubygems to 
  override defaults. [jasherai]

* Change: We now setup postfix as a satellite mail server. This is designed 
  to listen only on the local network interface and non-local mail to a relay
  host. [mbailey]

== 1.99.26 (August 22, 2008)

* added vnstat recipes - measure and report traffic on interface counters [mbailey]
* upgrade ruby to 1.8.6-p287 [Isaac Kearse] 
* upgrade to rubygems 1.2.0 - addresses memory utilization issues on
  low-memory boxes (half-gig or less) [thewoolleyman]
* deprec:rails:install_stack now installs mysql  [mbailey]
* turned tcp_nopush back on [mbailey]
* Correctly handle tarballs with .tgz extension [mbailey]
* Generate default remote config on install [mbailey]

== 1.99.24 (July  7, 2008)

* I've rejigged things to make it easier to install a service without having
  a local config directory. For example:

  cap deprec:nginx:install HOSTS=192.168.0.10  

  This will download and compile nginx, and push out a config file without 
  generating a local copy. You don't need a config/ dir and you don't need 
  to have defined a :web role.

  Meta-tasks (like deprec:rails:install_stack) can now pass a block of commands 
  to with_roles(roles).

  config_gen and config are still available but it's now possible to install 
  a rails stack without generating any local files. 

== 1.99.21 (June 17, 2008)

* added recipes and config templates for ar_sendmail
* added gitosis support
* added deprec:xen:migrate for "manually" moving slice between hosts

* added git support: install git, manage ssh users and create remote repositories

== 1.99.19 (June 3, 2008)

* feature: added logrotate. configs generated for nginx and mongrel
* bugfix: monit:install was calling monit:activate but this won't work will monit:config is called. 

== 1.99.18 (May  28, 2008)

* bugfix: nagios config option was not being set till after required

== 1.99.17 (May  22, 2008)

* monit config for mongrel now lives under config/mongrel instead of config/monit
  This way, monit configs for services can live with the recipes/templates for that service.

== 1.99.16 (May  5, 2008)

* change: start mongrel using mongrel_cluster with --clean option so mongrel 
  will start even when there are stale pids around.

* bugfix: nginx vhost template now uses :mongrel_port instead of 8000


== 1.99.15 (Mar 27, 2008)

* moved vmbuilder_plugins out of deprec dir 

== 1.99.14 (Feb 21, 2008)

* enhancement: updated how allowed hosts are generated
* bugfix: remove nginx index.html

== 1.99.8 (Feb 18, 2008)

* bugfix: Mongrel wasn't starting when server rebooted. [Mike Bailey]

* bugfix: Fixed .caprc content [Mike Bailey]

== 1.99.5 (Feb 12, 2008)

* feature: installs and configures monit to manage your mongrel processes [Mike Bailey]

* feature: When running config_gen,  if deprec discovers a file exists, checks 
           whether the new file differs from the existing one. If they're 
           identical, it skips it.

		   If they differ, the user is presented with the options to overwrite 
		   or not but now there's an extra option to view a diff of the changes 
		   that would occur. [Mike Bailey]

* change:  handle_command_with_input now accepts an optional response parameter.
           This is useful if you need to change a password on many servers and 
           don't want to have to keep entering the password at the prompt for
           each box. [Mike Bailey]

== 1.99.4 (Feb 11, 2008)

* Bugfix: set correct path to templates [Mike Bailey]

  - now don't fail if log files do not exist (e.g initial deployment)

    :update task but in all of these cases :symlink is called
